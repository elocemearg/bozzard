/*****************************************************************************
 * EVENT HANDLERS
 * 
 * boz applications are entirely event-driven. After the app's init call
 * returns, the app will not be given control again except in response to
 * events. For this reason, the app's init method will almost certainly
 * attach one or more event handlers, which will receive control whenever the
 * associated event occurs.
 *
 * When an event handler has control, the main loop doesn't, which means the
 * main loop can't respond to any other events. An event handler will not be
 * interrupted by another event handler - one event handler must return before
 * the next will be called. For this reason, event handlers MUST NOT BLOCK,
 * or events could be missed. Do not call delay() from an event handler. The
 * boz_display_* and boz_sound_* functions are safe to call from an event
 * handler, because these functions put commands on a queue to be dealt with
 * asynchronously.
 *
 * If an application needs to wait for a period of time before doing something,
 * consider setting an alarm event instead (see boz_set_alarm()).
 *
 * Event handlers corresponding to button presses, including the buzzers and
 * the QM controls (play, reset, yellow, and the rotary knob), are "sticky" -
 * they will be called once for each time the event happens, and the handler
 * does not need to re-attach itself.
 *
 * An event handler can be detached by setting its handler function to NULL.
 * The application will then not receive any more calls for that event unless
 * and until the event handler is re-attached.
 *
 * Other event handlers - those not associated with button presses - are
 * usually one-shot only. This includes the event handler for telling the
 * application that the sound queue is no longer full. These event handlers
 * will be detached by the main loop immediately before being called. If the
 * application wants to be called again the next time the event happens, the
 * event handler must manually re-attach itself by calling the appropriate
 * boz_set_event_handler_...() function.
