/******************************************************************************
 *
 * To create a new app:
 *
 * 1. Create a new .ino file for your app, which is where all your
 *    application's code goes, and #include "boz_api.h".
 *    This app must have (at least) an init function.
 *    This init function returns void and takes a single void * argument. If
 *    your app is called from the main menu, this argument will be NULL.
 *    See sysinfo.ino (which displays version information) for an example of
 *    a simple app.
 *
 * 2. Add a symbol for your app in the BOZ_APP_ID enum in boz_app_inits.h.
 *    For example, if your app is called FOOBAR, you might add the symbol
 *    BOZ_APP_ID_FOOBAR.
 *
 * 3. Add a declaration for your apps init function in the same file,
 *    boz_app_inits.h. It should look like all the others, e.g.:
 *        extern void foobar_init(void *);
 *
 * 4. Add an entry for your app into the struct boz_app app_list[] array in
 *    boz_app_list.ino. The four fields in the entry are your app's ID, your
 *    app's name (up to 16 characters), your app's init function, and any
 *    flags for this app entry. If you want your app to appear in the main menu
 *    the flags value should be BOZ_APP_MAIN. For example, the entry for the
 *    FOOBAR application might be this:
 *        { BOZ_APP_ID_FOOBAR, "Foobar", foobar_init, BOZ_APP_MAIN }
 *
 * 5. When you build the Bozzard software, your app should now be included.

/******************************************************************************
 * EVENT HANDLERS
 * 
 * Bozzard applications are entirely event-driven. After the app's init call
 * returns, the app will not be given control again except in response to
 * events. For this reason, the app's init method will almost certainly
 * attach one or more event handlers, which will receive control whenever the
 * associated event occurs.
 *
 * When an event handler has control, the main loop doesn't, which means the
 * main loop can't respond to any other events. An event handler will not be
 * interrupted by another event handler - one event handler must return before
 * the next will be called. For this reason, event handlers MUST NOT BLOCK,
 * or events could be missed. Do not call delay() from an event handler. The
 * boz_display_* and boz_sound_* functions are safe to call from an event
 * handler, because these functions put commands on a queue to be dealt with
 * asynchronously.
 *
 * If an application needs to wait for a period of time before doing something,
 * consider setting an alarm event instead (see boz_set_alarm()).
 *
 * Event handlers corresponding to button presses, including the buzzers and
 * the QM controls (play, reset, yellow, and the rotary knob), are "sticky" -
 * they will be called once for each time the event happens, and the handler
 * does not need to re-attach itself.
 *
 * An event handler can be detached by setting its handler function to NULL.
 * The application will then not receive any more calls for that event unless
 * and until the event handler is re-attached.
 *
 * Other event handlers - those not associated with button presses - are
 * usually one-shot only. This includes the event handler for telling the
 * application that the sound queue is no longer full. These event handlers
 * will be detached by the main loop immediately before being called. If the
 * application wants to be called again the next time the event happens, the
 * event handler must manually re-attach itself by calling the appropriate
 * boz_set_event_handler_...() function.
 *
 * If an application calls another application, each running application has a
 * separate list of event handlers. So you don't need to worry about messing up
 * any event handler settings for a calling application - when your app exits
 * and returns control to the calling app, the calling app will see all the
 * event handler settings exactly the same as they were before your app
 * started.
